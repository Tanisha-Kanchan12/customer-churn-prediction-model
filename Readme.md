# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
Customer churn prediction is a supervised machine learning project aimed at identifying whether a customer is likely to discontinue a service.  
This project uses the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset** to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, starting from raw data preprocessing to building a predictive system.

The project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
- Training and comparing multiple ML models
- Selecting the best model
- Saving and loading the trained model
- Making predictions on new customer data


## 🎯 Objective
- Predict customer churn accurately
- Understand factors influencing customer churn
- Compare different machine learning models
- Build a reusable churn prediction system


## 📂 Dataset Information
- **Dataset:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- **Total Records:** 7043
- **Target Variable:** `Churn`
  - `1` → Customer churned
  - `0` → Customer retained


## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Pickle
- XGBoost
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree

## 🔁 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- CSV file loaded using Pandas
- Dataset shape and structure explored

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Dropped unnecessary column (`customerID`)
- Converted `TotalCharges` from string to numeric
- Handled missing and blank values

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis using histograms
- Outlier detection using box plots
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps
- Count plots for categorical features

### 4️⃣ Target Encoding
- Converted `Churn` column:
  - `Yes → 1`
  - `No → 0`

### 5️⃣ Feature Encoding
- Applied **Label Encoding** on categorical variables
- Saved encoders using Pickle for future predictions

### 6️⃣ Handling Class Imbalance
- Used **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**
- Balanced churn and non-churn classes in training data

### 7️⃣ Train-Test Split
- Dataset split into 80% training and 20% testing data


## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

| Model | Description |
|-----|------------|
| Decision Tree Classifier | Rule-based model |
| Random Forest Classifier | Ensemble learning model |
| XGBoost Random Forest | Boosted ensemble model |


## 📊 Model Evaluation
- 5-fold cross-validation performed
- Evaluation metrics used:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

### ✅ Best Model Selected
**Random Forest Classifier**  
Chosen due to better performance and generalization.


## 💾 Model Saving
- Trained Random Forest model saved using Pickle
- Encoders saved separately for future predictions


## 🔮 Predictive System
- Loaded saved model and encoders
- Accepted new customer input data
- Applied encoding and prediction
- Output:
  - Churn / No Churn
  - Prediction probability
